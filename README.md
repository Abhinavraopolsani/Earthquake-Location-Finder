# Earthquake-Location-Finder
This Repo contains all meta files for Earthquake Location Finder using Apex:Maps  
I will give a walkthrough of how I leveraged Apex:Maps in order to display the markers of locations related to earthquake, getting from a third party site and display it on google maps. We can use JavaScript to achieve this solution but the scalability of that solution is going to be just for that particular site. Another example where you can leverage this solution is instead of getting earthquake data we can have live data of a Company Asset where exactly it has been accessed and where exactly it has been before Lost/Stolen from the site where it is tracking.
